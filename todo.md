# To-Do List

This file combines the development plan from `trea.md` and `copilot.md` and the UI implementation plan from `plan.md` into a comprehensive to-do list.

## I. UI Implementation for Signature Type Selection (from plan.md)

1.  **Read `test_multi_signature.php`:** Analyze the existing structure and code to understand how multi-signature processes are currently handled.
2.  **Analyze Existing Signature Support:** Detail how chain and parallel signatures are currently implemented.
3.  **Design UI for Signature Type Selection:** Create a user interface that allows users to easily select between chain and parallel signature options. Consider using radio buttons or a dropdown menu.
4.  **Integrate UI into HTML Form:** Add the designed UI elements to the HTML form in `test_multi_signature.php`. Ensure proper form submission and data handling.
5.  **Implement PHP Code for Signature Processes:** Write PHP code to handle the selected signature type (chain or parallel). This code should initiate or manage the appropriate signature processes based on the user's choice.
6.  **Implement JavaScript Code for UI Interaction:** Write JavaScript code to handle user interactions with the UI elements. This may include form validation, dynamic UI updates, and AJAX requests.
7.  **Update Database and Signature Processes:** Modify the database schema and signature processes as needed to accommodate the new signature type selection functionality.

## II. Development Plan (from trea.md and copilot.md)
