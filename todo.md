# To-Do List

This file combines the development plan from `trea.md` and the UI implementation plan from `plan.md` into a comprehensive to-do list.

## I. UI Implementation for Signature Type Selection (from plan.md)

1.  **Read `test_multi_signature.php`:** Analyze the existing structure and code to understand how multi-signature processes are currently handled.
2.  **Analyze Existing Signature Support:** Detail how chain and parallel signatures are currently implemented.
3.  **Design UI for Signature Type Selection:** Create a user interface that allows users to easily select between chain and parallel signature options. Consider using radio buttons or a dropdown menu.
4.  **Integrate UI into HTML Form:** Add the designed UI elements to the HTML form in `test_multi_signature.php`. Ensure proper form submission and data handling.
5.  **Implement PHP Code for Signature Processes:** Write PHP code to handle the selected signature type (chain or parallel). This code should initiate or manage the appropriate signature processes based on the user's choice.
6.  **Implement JavaScript Code for UI Interaction:** Write JavaScript code to handle user interactions with the UI elements. This may include form validation, dynamic UI updates, and AJAX requests.
7.  **Update Database and Signature Processes:** Modify the database schema and signature processes as needed to accommodate the new signature type selection functionality.

## II. Development Plan (from trea.md)

### A. Security Improvements (Immediate - 1-3 months)

1.  **Admin Panel Security Update:**
    *   [ ] Remove hardcoded admin password in `admin/auth.php` and `admin/login.php`.
    *   [ ] Implement secure password hashing algorithm (bcrypt) for admin passwords.
    *   [ ] Create a database table for admin users to store usernames and hashed passwords.
    *   [ ] Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for admin login.
    *   [ ] Strengthen session management and security controls in the admin panel.
2.  **General Security Improvements:**
    *   [ ] Implement XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) protection.
    *   [ ] Implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.
    *   [ ] Strengthen input validations to prevent injection attacks.
    *   [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   [ ] Enforce SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit.
    *   [ ] Optimize security headers to prevent common web attacks.

### B. Performance Optimizations (Immediate - 1-3 months)

1.  **PDF Processing Optimization:**
    *   [ ] Implement chunk-based upload system for large PDF files to reduce memory usage.
    *   [ ] Implement a queue system for PDF processing to handle large volumes of signing requests.
    *   [ ] Implement caching mechanism to store processed PDFs and reduce processing time.
    *   [ ] Optimize PDF compression to reduce file size and improve download speed.
2.  **Database Optimization:**
    *   [ ] Review indexing strategy to improve query performance.
    *   [ ] Optimize queries to reduce database load.
    *   [ ] Implement connection pooling to reduce database connection overhead.
    *   [ ] Database partitioning strategy (consider for very large datasets).

### C. User Experience Improvements (Immediate - 1-3 months)

1.  **Interface Improvements:**
    *   [ ] Implement modern and responsive design for a better user experience on all devices.
    *   [ ] Dark mode support for improved accessibility and user preference.
    *   [ ] Progress indicators and loading animations to provide feedback during long operations.
    *   [ ] Drag & drop file upload support for a more intuitive user experience.
    *   [ ] AJAX-based form submissions for a smoother and faster user experience.
2.  **Signing Process Improvements:**
    *   [ ] Batch signing support to allow users to sign multiple documents at once.
    *   [ ] Visual selector for signature position to allow users to precisely place their signature.
    *   [ ] Signature templates system to allow users to save and reuse signature settings.
    *   [ ] Automatic signature placement suggestions to help users quickly place their signature.

### D. New Features (Mid-Term - 3-6 months)

1.  **Document Management:**
    *   [ ] Folder structure and document organization to allow users to easily manage their documents.
    *   [ ] Document versioning system to track changes to documents over time.
    *   [ ] Document metadata management to allow users to add and edit metadata for their documents.
    *   [ ] Document search and filtering to allow users to quickly find the documents they need.
2.  **Workflow Management:**
    *   [ ] Customizable signature workflows to allow users to define their own signature processes.
    *   [ ] Email notifications to keep users informed about the status of their signature requests.
    *   [ ] Reminders and deadline tracking to help users stay on top of their signature tasks.
    *   [ ] Workflow templates to allow users to quickly create common signature workflows.
3.  **API and Integration:**
        *   REST API Development:
            *   [ ] Comprehensive API documentation.
            *   [ ] API versioning.
            *   [ ] API rate limiting.
            *   [ ] OAuth2 implementation.
4.  **Test and Quality:**
