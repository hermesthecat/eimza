# Plan for Creating a PDF Signing Application with Kolay Imza API

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a simple PDF signing application using the Kolay Imza API with PHP and a modern Bootstrap interface.

## Steps

1.  **Research Kolay Imza API:**
    *   Review the `docs/KolayImzaAPI-master/README.md` and `docs/kolayimza (06.03.2025 21：41：36).html` files to understand the API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.
    *   Identify the specific API endpoint for signing a PDF document.
    *   Determine the required parameters for the signing request, such as the PDF file, signature format, and any other relevant options.
2.  **Set up Development Environment:**
    *   Create a new directory for the project.
    *   Initialize a PHP project in the directory.
    *   Install the Bootstrap CSS framework.
    *   Set up a local web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to host the application.
    *   Set up a database connection (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
3.  **Create Basic UI with Bootstrap:**
    *   Create an HTML form with Bootstrap styling for uploading the PDF file and submitting the signing request.
    *   Include fields for any additional parameters required by the Kolay Imza API, such as signature format or options.
4.  **Implement PDF Upload Functionality:**
    *   Write PHP code to handle the PDF file upload.
    *   Store the uploaded PDF file temporarily on the server.
5.  **Call Kolay Imza API to Sign PDF:**
    *   Write PHP code to construct the API request with the necessary parameters, including the uploaded PDF file.
    *   Use a PHP HTTP client (e.g., cURL) to send the API request to the Kolay Imza API endpoint.
    *   Handle the API response and extract the signed PDF document.
6.  **Implement Database Logging:**
    *   Create a database table to store signature information (e.g., filename, signature details, timestamp).
    *   Write PHP code to insert signature details into the database after successful signing.
7.  **Display Signed PDF:**
    *   Write PHP code to display the signed PDF document in the browser.
    *   Provide an option to download the signed PDF file.
8.  **Implement Error Handling:**
    *   Implement error handling throughout the application to catch any exceptions or errors that may occur.
    *   Display user-friendly error messages to the user.
9.  **Test Thoroughly:**
    *   Test the application thoroughly with different PDF files and signature options.
    *   Verify that the signed PDF documents are valid and meet the required standards.
    *   Verify that signature information is correctly stored in the database.
10. **Deploy Application:**
    *   Deploy the application to a production web server.
    *   Configure the web server to handle the PDF file uploads and API requests.
    *   Configure the database connection.
